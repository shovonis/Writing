\begin{abstract}
There are many metrics have been proposed so far for the evaluation of the performance of the parallel algorithm running on a parallel processor. In this paper, we propose a new metric Serial Fraction, it reveals some of the facts which could not be achieved by traditional well known metrics such as elapsed time, price/performance, speed up, efficiency etc. Our proposed new metric aims at defining a new methodology to analyze the computational performances of parallel applications. Five experimental scenarios have been presented on Floyd shortest path algorithm running as parallel application with different number of nodes; showing that serial fraction could be an effective means for performance evaluation.
